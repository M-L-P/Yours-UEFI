#dont_scan_tools ESP2:/EFI/ubuntu/mmx64.efi,gptsync_x64.efi

#####		----{set to ignore some EFI tools to scan}----
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tool binaries to be excluded from the tools line, even if the
# general class is specified in showtools. This enables trimming an
# overabundance of tools, as when you see multiple mok_tool entries
# after installing multiple Linux distributions.
# Just as with dont_scan_files, you can specify a filename alone, a
# full pathname, or a volume identifier (filesystem label, partition
# name, or partition GUID) and a full pathname.
# Default is an empty list (nothing is excluded)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

scanfor internal, external, optical, manual

#####		----{set which types of boot loaders to search}----
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Which types of boot loaders to search, and in what order to display them:
#  internal      - internal EFI disk-based boot loaders
#  external      - external EFI disk-based boot loaders
#  optical       - EFI optical discs (CD, DVD, etc.)
#  netboot       - EFI network (PXE) boot options
#  hdbios        - BIOS disk-based boot loaders
#  biosexternal  - BIOS external boot loaders (USB, eSATA, etc.)
#  cd            - BIOS optical-disc boot loaders
#  manual        - use stanzas later in this configuration file
#  firmware      - boot EFI programs set in the firmware's NVRAM
# Note that the legacy BIOS options require firmware support, which is
# not present on all computers.
# The netboot option is experimental and relies on the ipxe.efi and
# ipxe_discover.efi program files.
# On UEFI PCs, default is internal,external,optical,manual
# On Macs, default is internal,hdbios,external,biosexternal,optical,cd,manual
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

uefi_deep_legacy_scan false

#####			----{set whether to scan legacy deep}----
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# By default, rEFInd relies on the UEFI firmware to detect BIOS-mode boot
# devices. This sometimes doesn't detect all the available devices, though.
# For these cases, uefi_deep_legacy_scan results in a forced scan and
# modification of NVRAM variables on each boot. Adding "0", "off", or
# "false" resets to the default value. This token has no effect on Macs or
# when no BIOS-mode options are set via scanfor.
# Default is unset (or "uefi_deep_legacy_scan false")
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

scan_delay 0

#####			----{set how many seconds it will delay }----
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Delay for the specified number of seconds before scanning disks.
# This can help some users who find that some of their disks
# (usually external or optical discs) aren't detected initially,
# but are detected after pressing Esc.
# The default is 0.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#also_scan_dirs boot,ESP2:EFI/linux/kernels
#also_scan_dirs boot,@/boot
#also_scan_dirs +,@/kernels

#####			----{set to scan where else you want}----
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When scanning volumes for EFI boot loaders, rEFInd always looks for
# macOS's and Microsoft Windows' boot loaders in their normal locations,
# and scans the root directory and every subdirectory of the /EFI directory
# for additional boot loaders, but it doesn't recurse into these directories.
# The also_scan_dirs token adds more directories to the scan list.
# Directories are specified relative to the volume's root directory. This
# option applies to ALL the volumes that rEFInd scans UNLESS you include
# a volume name and colon before the directory name, as in "myvol:/somedir"
# to scan the somedir directory only on the filesystem named myvol. If a
# specified directory doesn't exist, it's ignored (no error condition
# results). The "+" symbol denotes appending to the list of scanned
# directories rather than overwriting that list.
# The default is to scan the "boot" and "@/boot" directories in addition
# to various hard-coded directories.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dont_scan_volumes "LRS_ESP", "Recovery HD", "Basic data partition", "Linux data partition", "FYDEOS-DUAL-BOOT"

#####			----{set to ignore partitions to scan}----
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Partitions (or whole disks, for legacy-mode boots) to omit from scans.
# For EFI-mode scans, you normally specify a volume by its label, which you
# can obtain in an EFI shell by typing "vol", from Linux by typing
# "blkid /dev/{devicename}", or by examining the disk's label in various
# OSes' file browsers. It's also possible to identify a partition by its
# unique GUID (aka its "PARTUUID" in Linux parlance). (Note that this is
# NOT the partition TYPE CODE GUID.) This identifier can be obtained via
# "blkid" in Linux or "diskutil info {partition-id}" in macOS.
# For legacy-mode scans, you can specify any subset of the boot loader
# description shown when you highlight the option in rEFInd.
# The default is "LRS_ESP".
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dont_scan_dirs +,ESP:/EFI/boot,EFI/Dell,EFI/Boot,EFI/refind,EFI/Yours,EFI/CLOVER

#####			----{set to ignore directories to scan}----
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Directories that should NOT be scanned for boot loaders. By default,
# rEFInd doesn't scan its own directory, the EFI/tools directory, the
# EFI/memtest directory, the EFI/memtest86 directory, or the
# com.apple.recovery.boot directory. Using the dont_scan_dirs option
# enables you to "blacklist" other directories; but be sure to use "+"
# as the first element if you want to continue blacklisting existing
# directories. You might use this token to keep EFI/boot/bootx64.efi out
# of the menu if that's a duplicate of another boot loader or to exclude
# a directory that holds drivers or non-bootloader utilities provided by
# a hardware manufacturer. If a directory is listed both here and in
# also_scan_dirs, dont_scan_dirs takes precedence. Note that this
# blacklist applies to ALL the filesystems that rEFInd scans, not just
# the ESP, unless you precede the directory name by a filesystem name or
# partition unique GUID, as in "myvol:EFI/somedir" to exclude EFI/somedir
# from the scan on the myvol volume but not on other volumes.

#dont_scan_files +,gcd{arch}.efi,mm{arch}.efi,shim{arch}.efi,grub{arch}.efi,bootia32.efi
dont_scan_files +,gcd{arch}.efi,mm{arch}.efi,shim{arch}.efi,bootia32.efi,bootx64.efi

#####			----{set to ignore files to scan}----
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Files that should NOT be included as EFI boot loaders (on the
# first line of the display). If you're using a boot loader that
# relies on support programs or drivers that are installed alongside
# the main binary or if you want to "blacklist" certain loaders by
# name rather than location, use this option. Note that this will
# NOT prevent certain binaries from showing up in the second-row
# set of tools. Most notably, various Secure Boot and recovery
# tools are present in this list, but may appear as second-row
# items.
# The file may be specified as a bare name (e.g., "notme.efi"), as
# a complete pathname (e.g., "/EFI/somedir/notme.efi"), or as a
# complete pathname with volume (e.g., "SOMEDISK:/EFI/somedir/notme.efi"
# or 2C17D5ED-850D-4F76-BA31-47A561740082:/EFI/somedir/notme.efi").
# OS tags hidden via the Delete or '-' key in the rEFInd menu are
# added to this list, but stored in NVRAM.
# The default is shim.efi,shim-fedora.efi,shimx64.efi,PreLoader.efi,
# TextMode.efi,ebounce.efi,GraphicsConsole.efi,MokManager.efi,HashTool.efi,
# HashTool-signed.efi,bootmgr.efi,fb{arch}.efi
# (where "{arch}" is the architecture code, like "x64").
# If you want to keep these defaults but add to them, be sure to
# specify "+" as the first item in the new list; if you don't, then
# items from the default list are likely to appear.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#dont_scan_firmware HARDDISK,shell,"Removable Device"

#####			----{set to ignore variables to scan}----
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EFI NVRAM Boot#### variables that should NOT be presented as loaders
# when "firmware" is an option to "scanfor". The comma-separated list
# presented here contains strings that are matched against the
# description field -- if a value here is a case-insensitive substring
# of the boot option description, then it will be excluded from the
# boot list. To specify a string that includes a space, enclose it
# in quotes. Specifying "shell" will counteract the automatic
# inclusion of built-in EFI shells.
